## Subject
### Mandatory
This function aims to read file from a file descriptor (fd) and get a line, parsing the input file and handling the memory allocation.

### Bonus
In addition to the mandatory functionality, the bonus part extends the capability to handle multiple file descriptors concurrently. This means the function should be able to manage and read from various file descriptors simultaneously.

## Getting Started
```shell
git clone https://github.com/niamu01/get_next_line
cd get_next_line
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
```
> 💡 A buffer size of 42 is used as an example

## How To Use
The `int get_next_line(int fd, char **line)` function can be utilized not only within the main function for testing purposes but also within other parts of your program.

Parameter:
- fd: file descriptor of the file to read from
- line: the value of what has been read

Return:
-	1 : A line has been read
- 0 : EOF has been reached
- -1 : An error happened

### Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	int fd = open("FILE_NAME", O_RDONLY);
	char *line;
	int	ret;

	while ((ret = get_next_line(fd, &line)) > 0) {
		printf("Line read: %s\n", line);
		free(line);
	}
	
	if (ret == 0)
		printf("End of file reached\n");
	else if (ret == -1)
		printf("An error occurred\n");
	
	return 0;
}
```
